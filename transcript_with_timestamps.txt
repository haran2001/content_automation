[0:00:00 - 0:00:04.840000] So, I want to remind everybody that you are a security investor, which means that you
[0:00:04.840000 - 0:00:10.060000] buy individual stocks, and in some cases, sell individual stocks short.
[0:00:10.060000 - 0:00:16.320000] But the natural question many people would have for a value investor right now is this.
[0:00:16.320000 - 0:00:21.879999] After a 10% or almost 10% sell-off, to the degree that you look at the market and decide
[0:00:21.879999 - 0:00:25.160000] whether it's cheap or expensive, is it cheap?
[0:00:25.160000 - 0:00:26.160000] Sure.
[0:00:26.160000 - 0:00:32.040001] We actually value all the businesses in the S&P 500 bottoms up, and we have good data
[0:00:32.040001 - 0:00:34.080002] going back to 1990.
[0:00:34.080002 - 0:00:37.799999] So we can actually contextualize where do we stand today according to the way we value
[0:00:37.799999 - 0:00:41.700001] our measures of absolute and relative value that we use, and we apply them consistently
[0:00:41.700001 - 0:00:43.360001] over the 28 years.
[0:00:43.360001 - 0:00:48.200001] And right now, we're in the 22nd percentile towards expensive over the last 28 years,
[0:00:48.200001 - 0:00:52.919998] meaning the market's been cheaper 78% of the time, more expensive 22% of the time.
[0:00:52.919998 - 0:00:56.480000] Now this isn't a projection, but we can go back in time and look from this valuation
[0:00:56.480000 - 0:00:59.959999] percentile in the past, what's happened over the next year or two.
[0:04:00 - 0:04:04.220000] And market's up 4 to 6% over the next year, 10 to 12 over the next two.
[0:04:04.220000 - 0:04:10.340000] So subnormal, meaning during that 28-year period, market was up about 10% a year.
[0:04:10.340000 - 0:04:12.760000] And we're expensive, or above average.
[0:04:12.760000 - 0:04:17.480000] So 4 to 6 is closer to what's happened in the past over the next year.
[0:04:17.480000 - 0:04:25.260000] The market has repriced from its peak P.E. by about four, four and a half times.
[0:04:25.260000 - 0:04:27.320000] Do you see that as healthy?
[0:04:27.320000 - 0:04:29.020000] You know, we don't really look at P.E.
[0:04:29.020000 - 0:04:34.180000] We're really looking at cash flows, and so we're pretty consistent about that.
[0:04:34.180000 - 0:04:35.900002] And so market's gotten somewhat cheaper.
[0:04:35.900002 - 0:04:40.779999] I mean, it was down, maybe towards the end of September, it was probably down about the
[0:04:40.779999 - 0:04:41.779999] 14th percentile.
[0:04:41.779999 - 0:04:47.220001] Now, it's back at the 22nd, so it's dropped, but it's not cheap.
[0:04:47.220001 - 0:04:52.099998] But then again, what could happen from here, you know, in the 22nd percentile, with expected
[0:04:52.099998 - 0:04:53.779999] returns of 4 to 6%?
[0:04:53.779999 - 0:04:58.259998] One way to get back, and no guarantee that we get back to those expected returns of 10%
[0:04:58.259998 - 0:05:00.020000] or so, but one way you could get back...
[0:08:00 - 0:08:04.240000] is if the market fell 18 or 20 percent tomorrow, the expected returns going forward from there
[0:08:04.240000 - 0:08:07.500000] would get closer to 10 percent a year.
[0:08:07.500000 - 0:08:10.860000] But that doesn't have to happen, because if the market just under-earned, meaning had
[0:08:10.860000 - 0:08:15.760000] subnormal returns of 4 to 6 percent in each of the next three years, then three years
[0:08:15.760000 - 0:08:19.719999] from now with a normal earnings trajectory, we'd also be back to a 10 percent expected
[0:08:19.719999 - 0:08:20.719999] return.
[0:08:20.719999 - 0:08:26.400000] So it's really not helpful for me to know what's going to happen in the next few months,
[0:08:26.400000 - 0:08:31.320000] but it is helpful from an investment standpoint of, you know, what are the prospects for the
[0:08:31.320000 - 0:08:38.119999] market in general and how exposed, if you're really taking portfolio exposure to the market,
[0:08:38.119999 - 0:08:39.959999] you know, where should you be?
[0:08:39.959999 - 0:08:45.580002] Joel, tech stocks, and in particular the FAANGs, have led this recent sell-off.
[0:08:45.580002 - 0:08:51.220001] How cheap would those stocks have to get to appeal to a value investor like you?
[0:08:51.220001 - 0:08:53.680000] You know, it's interesting.
[0:08:53.680000 - 0:08:59.119999] The things that wear short are generally trading at 50 or 100 times earnings or losing money.
[0:08:59.119999 - 0:09:00] Those are your sort of choices.
[0:12:00 - 0:12:02.440000] of the things that we're gonna be shorting.
[0:12:02.440000 - 0:12:05.720000] So within that group will often be certain types
[0:12:05.720000 - 0:12:09.880000] of fang stocks, if they're not earning a lot of money yet,
[0:12:09.880000 - 0:12:13.520000] and people are pricing it on 2024 earnings,
[0:12:13.520000 - 0:12:16.760000] and they have a lot of high hopes involved there.
[0:12:16.760000 - 0:12:19.080000] And we're not really opining,
[0:12:19.080000 - 0:12:20.660000] we own hundreds of stocks on the long side
[0:12:20.660000 - 0:12:22.280001] and hundreds of stocks on the short side.
[0:12:22.280001 - 0:12:23.920000] So the bucket of companies that are trading
[0:12:23.920000 - 0:12:26.540001] at 50 or 100 times pre-tax free cash flows,
[0:12:26.540001 - 0:12:27.639999] we're losing money.
[0:12:28.600000 - 0:12:31.379999] Historically, that's the world's worst investment strategy.
[0:12:31.379999 - 0:12:33.560001] There will be some winners within that group,
[0:12:33.560001 - 0:12:37.080002] and you'll actually know their names, because they won.
[0:12:37.080002 - 0:12:39.799999] But I call that the tyranny of the anecdote, okay?
[0:12:39.799999 - 0:12:42.160000] It's really the world's worst investment strategy
[0:12:42.160000 - 0:12:45.560001] as a group, but some of them will win,
[0:12:45.560001 - 0:12:47.900002] and you'll know their names because they won.
[0:12:47.900002 - 0:12:50.720001] But as a group, it's a bad investment strategy.
[0:12:50.720001 - 0:12:52.759998] So we're really concentrating on companies
[0:12:52.759998 - 0:12:55.400002] that have seven, eight, 9% free cash flow yields
[0:12:55.400002 - 0:12:57.279999] and a 3% interest rate environment.
[0:16:00 - 0:16:04] Some of those may be priced cheaply
[0:16:04 - 0:16:07.360000] because people are a little concerned about the future,
[0:16:07.360000 - 0:16:08.760000] even though they're earning lots of cash flow.
[0:16:08.760000 - 0:16:10.160000] Now we try to stick to companies
[0:16:10.160000 - 0:16:12.220000] that are gushing free cash flow,
[0:16:12.220000 - 0:16:13.240000] huge returns on capital,
[0:16:13.240000 - 0:16:15.560000] meaning they deploy their capital well.
[0:16:15.560000 - 0:16:18.559999] That avoids some of the value traps from traditional value.
[0:16:18.559999 - 0:16:20.680000] And so I think that brings up the point,
[0:16:20.680000 - 0:16:22.680000] we don't really think of value as low price book,
[0:16:22.680000 - 0:16:23.760000] low price sales investing.
[0:16:23.760000 - 0:16:26.420000] We're actually valuing businesses based on cash flows,
[0:16:26.420000 - 0:16:28.440001] like a private equity investor would.
[0:16:28.440001 - 0:16:29.600000] And so if you're trying to figure out
[0:16:30.080000 - 0:16:32.080002] what a company's worth and buy it for less
[0:16:32.080002 - 0:16:34.360001] at a bigger discount, that will never go out of favor,
[0:16:34.360001 - 0:16:38.119999] even if value as defined by Russell or Morningstar,
[0:16:38.119999 - 0:16:40.520000] which is low price book, low price sales investing,
[0:16:40.520000 - 0:16:43.520000] that may or may not stay in vogue.
[0:16:43.520000 - 0:16:45.759998] It may be out of favor sometimes, in favor,
[0:16:45.759998 - 0:16:48.680000] may not even outperform the market going forward.
[0:16:48.680000 - 0:16:49.959999] That doesn't mean that much to me
[0:16:49.959999 - 0:16:52.639999] because those have been correlations
[0:16:52.639999 - 0:16:54.119999] that have worked with more than your fair share
[0:16:54.119999 - 0:16:55.480000] of companies that are out of favor.
[0:16:55.480000 - 0:16:58.400002] I don't imagine they'll come back at some point,
[0:16:58.400002 - 0:17:00.480000] but we're actually valuing businesses.
[0:20:00 - 0:20:02] based on cash flows, and that's what stocks are,
[0:20:02 - 0:20:03.340000] ownership shares of businesses.
[0:20:03.340000 - 0:20:07.420000] There are early indications in recent weeks
[0:20:07.420000 - 0:20:09.540000] that maybe there's a shift,
[0:20:09.540000 - 0:20:12.820000] that maybe the premium investors have given
[0:20:12.820000 - 0:20:14.780000] to growth stocks is coming off,
[0:20:14.780000 - 0:20:18.340000] and perhaps they're beginning to appreciate value once again.
[0:20:18.340000 - 0:20:20.420000] It's been about a decade since they genuinely
[0:20:20.420000 - 0:20:23.200001] appreciated value, if not perhaps a bit longer.
[0:20:23.200001 - 0:20:24.340000] What are you seeing?
[0:20:24.340000 - 0:20:28.900000] Yeah, so while I say we're not traditional value investors
[0:20:29.139999 - 0:20:30.980000] and we're usually categorized by, let's say,
[0:20:30.980000 - 0:20:32.740002] a Russell or a Morningstar as blend,
[0:20:32.740002 - 0:20:34.060001] as Warren Buffett would say,
[0:20:34.060001 - 0:20:35.759998] growth and value are tied at the hip,
[0:20:35.759998 - 0:20:38.220001] that's part of valuation.
[0:20:38.220001 - 0:20:40.959999] So they put us in blend, not traditional value.
[0:20:40.959999 - 0:20:43.279999] But when growth is really going,
[0:20:43.279999 - 0:20:45.220001] and these are the companies priced on hope
[0:20:45.220001 - 0:20:48.860001] and what's gonna happen in 2024, 2025,
[0:20:48.860001 - 0:20:50.500000] when those are doing really well,
[0:20:51.419998 - 0:20:55.459999] they're probably not gonna love what we're doing as much.
[0:20:55.459999 - 0:20:57.580002] In other words, so we would rhyme a little more
[0:20:57.580002 - 0:20:59.980000] with traditional value, and so in those.
[0:24:00 - 0:24:03.700000] These type of frothy markets, that's not our market,
[0:24:03.700000 - 0:24:06] but those don't last forever.
[0:24:06 - 0:24:08.480000] Prices have gotten pretty high, and like I said,
[0:24:08.480000 - 0:24:10.240000] that doesn't mean that the FAANG stocks
[0:24:10.240000 - 0:24:12.120000] or some of the names that you're familiar with
[0:24:12.120000 - 0:24:14.620000] won't do well, or they won't meet the expectations
[0:24:14.620000 - 0:24:15.580000] that people think.
[0:24:15.580000 - 0:24:19.959999] It's just that as a group, the growth group
[0:24:19.959999 - 0:24:23.020000] where people just pay up for expected growth
[0:24:23.020000 - 0:24:25.559999] over the next five years, that's probably,
[0:24:25.559999 - 0:24:28.360001] as you suggest, have been a little frothy.
[0:24:28.400000 - 0:24:30.160000] I don't expect that to come back to earth.
[0:24:30.160000 - 0:24:31.520000] What do you think the catalyst for that
[0:24:31.520000 - 0:24:33.160000] is going to be, rising interest rates?
[0:24:33.160000 - 0:24:35.200001] I mean, the real answer is I don't know.
[0:24:35.200001 - 0:24:37.360001] I would just say that it always happens.
[0:24:37.360001 - 0:24:40.840000] In other words, if the pendulum swings too much one way,
[0:24:40.840000 - 0:24:43.680000] they'll be, just like we had a correction in October,
[0:24:43.680000 - 0:24:44.520000] that could happen.
[0:24:44.520000 - 0:24:47.520000] Things in general are more expensive than usual,
[0:24:47.520000 - 0:24:49.939999] but like I said, it could play out in a lot of different ways.
[0:24:49.939999 - 0:24:52.160000] Market could fall 18 or 20% tomorrow,
[0:24:52.160000 - 0:24:54.599998] or it could just under-earn at 4 to 6% a year
[0:24:54.599998 - 0:24:57.799999] for a few years, and that's the way it levels off,
[0:24:57.799999 - 0:25:00.200001] meaning lower returns than what you.
[0:28:00 - 0:28:02.040000] people have become conditioned.
[0:28:02.040000 - 0:28:06.200000] But surely some things must confuse you
[0:28:06.200000 - 0:28:09.100000] if you evaluate the market based on the things
[0:28:09.100000 - 0:28:10.320000] that you've observed in history.
[0:28:10.320000 - 0:28:11.880000] The degree to which, for example,
[0:28:11.880000 - 0:28:14.840000] companies with bad balance sheets haven't been punished.
[0:28:15.800000 - 0:28:19.120001] Yeah, so basically there's a reflexive component to that.
[0:28:19.120001 - 0:28:22.240000] One thing I didn't mention that the Russell 2000,
[0:28:22.240000 - 0:28:23.959999] which is the small cap universe,
[0:28:23.959999 - 0:28:26.260000] that's in the sixth percentile towards expensive,
[0:28:26.260000 - 0:28:28.400000] meaning it's been cheaper 94% of the time.
[0:28:28.400000 - 0:28:29.680000] And when it's been here in the past year,
[0:28:30.320000 - 0:28:31.559999] the pre-forward returns have been about flat.
[0:28:31.559999 - 0:28:34.040001] So depending on what companies we're talking about,
[0:28:34.040001 - 0:28:35.360001] that is super expensive.
[0:28:35.360001 - 0:28:37.580002] That should come back over time.
[0:28:37.580002 - 0:28:39.759998] It's usually not a good idea to lose money
[0:28:39.759998 - 0:28:42.240002] or buy things at 100 times pre-tax for cash flows.
[0:28:42.240002 - 0:28:43.080002] Just bad idea.
[0:28:43.080002 - 0:28:45.880001] Joel, I want to ask you a question about factors.
[0:28:45.880001 - 0:28:47.439999] You're not a systematic investor,
[0:28:47.439999 - 0:28:49] but I've wondered to myself
[0:28:49 - 0:28:50.880001] if there's any way you would ever embrace
[0:28:50.880001 - 0:28:52.799999] systematic value investing.
[0:28:52.799999 - 0:28:54.080002] And the reason I ask the question is
[0:28:54.080002 - 0:28:56.680000] because I know that you teach your students at Columbia
[0:28:56.680000 - 0:28:57.919998] to look at a security the way
[0:28:57.919998 - 0:29:00.119999] that they would consider buying a house.
[0:32:00 - 0:32:02.160000] But what if you were buying the neighborhood?
[0:32:02.160000 - 0:32:06.780000] Wouldn't you evaluate all the houses in the neighborhood on an aggregate basis and decide
[0:32:06.780000 - 0:32:10.680000] whether one neighborhood was cheap relative to another neighborhood being expensive and
[0:32:10.680000 - 0:32:16.500000] maybe the cheap neighborhood on aggregate was worth buying and maybe selling houses
[0:32:16.500000 - 0:32:19.639999] in aggregate in the expensive neighborhood?
[0:32:19.639999 - 0:32:20.639999] I hear you.
[0:32:20.639999 - 0:32:22.959999] Because over time, that's worked.
[0:32:22.959999 - 0:32:29.600000] The statistics suggest that value as a factor outperforms growth, it outperforms momentum,
[0:32:29.600000 - 0:32:32] it outperforms size, it outperforms everything.
[0:32:32 - 0:32:36.799999] Right, but the way people describe value factor as low price book, low price sales, I have
[0:32:36.799999 - 0:32:37.799999] no-
[0:32:37.799999 - 0:32:38.799999] Well, there are many ways to slice it.
[0:32:38.799999 - 0:32:43.639999] Right, but the way that they're categorized by, let's say, a Russell or a Morningstar
[0:32:43.639999 - 0:32:45.400002] is low price book, low price sales.
[0:32:45.400002 - 0:32:48.639999] And to me, that's not a factor that we look at, okay?
[0:32:48.639999 - 0:32:49.840000] We're looking at cash flow.
[0:32:49.840000 - 0:32:50.840000] So what happens to that-
[0:32:50.840000 - 0:32:52.400002] Would you consider doing it on cash flow?
[0:32:52.400002 - 0:32:53.400002] I do.
[0:32:53.400002 - 0:32:54.400002] That's what we do.
[0:32:54.400002 - 0:32:55.400002] We value businesses-
[0:32:55.400002 - 0:32:56.400002] You screen, you sure?
[0:32:56.400002 - 0:32:57.400002] Sure.
[0:32:57.400002 - 0:32:58.400002] And you brought up the house analogy.
[0:32:58.400002 - 0:32:59.400002] So-
[0:32:59.400002 - 0:32:59.400002] 
[0:36:00 - 0:36:02.080000] You know, if you're buying a house, it's pretty simple questions.
[0:36:02.080000 - 0:36:04.520000] They're asking a million dollars, your job is to figure out whether it's a good deal
[0:36:04.520000 - 0:36:05.520000] or not.
[0:36:05.520000 - 0:36:09.280000] So, one question you might ask is, if I rented it out and I could get 70 or $80,000 a year
[0:36:09.280000 - 0:36:12.760000] net of my expenses and interest rates are 3%, does that sound pretty good?
[0:36:12.760000 - 0:36:16.840000] How cheap is it relative to similar houses and all houses in all neighborhoods?
[0:36:16.840000 - 0:36:20.320000] So we look at a company, we say, how cheap is it relative to companies in the same industry?
[0:36:20.320000 - 0:36:23.040001] How cheap is it relative to all companies I can choose from?
[0:36:23.040001 - 0:36:26.799999] How cheap is it relative to how it's been priced over history relative to the market?
[0:36:26.799999 - 0:36:30.780001] These are measures of absolute relative value that anyone would use to value any earning
[0:36:30.780001 - 0:36:31.780001] asset.
[0:36:31.780001 - 0:36:37.639999] We can't value gold or Bitcoin that way, and that's why we pass, okay, we don't value.
[0:36:37.639999 - 0:36:43.959999] But earning assets, there are standard ways that everyone would value them and, you know,
[0:36:43.959999 - 0:36:47.759998] if you don't go crazy and you're very disciplined about it, there's plenty of opportunities
[0:36:47.759998 - 0:36:48.119999] always.
